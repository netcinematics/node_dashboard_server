# `~aHUMANaENIGMa~`

- All_non_visible_puzzle, that all_human_mind - has yet_to_see.

Observably, there exists many concepts_beyond_us.

> Like a bird and a cat cannot comprehend the moon, nor the ACTZ of struggle forced upon them to survive.

So too, exists all_human_mind, in aComplexa actual_reality. 

> all_human_mind looks upon, an actual_constant_Perplexeum of conceptz_aBeyondUs.

> With_great_irony, all_human_mind is forced into actual_double_confuzion, when we_guess_wrong.

And so, as affect_&_effect, the effort requires to solve the non_visible_enigma - is massively complex.

> Envolverone is the first observable human to solve the actual_human_enigma.

--------

## SOLUTION to actual_human_enigma

1) The area of unexplored concepts actually_beyond_all_human_mind

2) exactly, why we_cannot_see aspects of non_visible_human_enigma

3) understanding exactly, what exists under the actual_human_facade

4) finally, how to spark_into_mind concepts_aBeyondUs


---

## All_Human_Taboo

Some minds do not want extra concepts in their mind, which is to be observed and respected.

> Actual_reality cannot be exactly reflected into any mind

> There is alwayz distortion_around_the_edges_of_all_conceptz

> There is always a cognitive_viewz_of_all_conceptz

> Taboos must be seen, understood, and respected


### Distortion_around_the_edges

> AllHumanz, Look for Distortion_around_the_edges

With_great_irony,

on one hand, see a constant_non_exactness for every concept in mind...

on the other hand, see actual_exactness of state_of_ACTZ and state_of_CONCEPTZ.

That is the key_solution to actual_human_enigma, exactly in_the_inverzionz.


###  In_the_inverzionz

> AllHumanz, it is a great mistake to wrongly_reject viewz in_the_inverzionz. Because that is exactly where all the clues and solutions await_us. Await_Our_Focus, Await_Our_Evaluation, Await_Our_Correction, Await_Our_aSparka, Await_Our_Awareness.

> To often, ACTZ to reject what is exact_opposite. Ironically, actually_exactly_wrong
