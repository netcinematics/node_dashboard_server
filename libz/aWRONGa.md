### `~aByNatureaWronga~`

we_are_wrong_by_nature. From birth and then at death, clarity is observably absent.

As our senses spark on, and when our senses spark out - clarity arrives slowly and vanishes instantly - exactly like a flame.

Like a_flicker_of_life, there is also a_flicker_of_awareness, and a_flicker_of_conceptz in minds.

And the flicker_from_mind_to_mind is a_flicker_across_society. 

As we evolve, we must also be confuzed, before arriving gradually at actual_clearer_clarity.

aHistoricaWronga and aWrongAllaLonga are byNature, and it is aFollya to be ashamed of aWronga.

> We should not be ashamed of aWronga, but learn from it - alwayz.

We should not be punished for aWronga - we should be educated on the affect_&_effect of ACTZ.

### SITUATION of actual_exactly_wrong

> AllHUmanzLook, MEASURE_situations_of_clarity_by_details.
1) When situation_of_clarity exists, we_can_see_reflection_of_details.
2) When situation_of_confuzion exists, we_can_see_distorted_details.
3) When situation_of_illuzion exists, we_can_see_distraction_of_details.

Often, a guess is simply wrong, but look how massively it complicates human plans! ByNature, through ACTZ of affect_&_effect - actual_massive_chaos is caused across all_human_mind, by any single mind... that insists on actual_wrong_guess. 

> Actual_Natural_Wrongness appears to be root_cauze for `~aHumanaCharada~`

> When any one mind, insists_on_a_guess, it forces upon society ACTZ, that cannot be avoided.

Within existence of actual_human_confuzion - distinct_choizes arise:

1) we_chooze_confuzion, when we_wrongly_reject_clarity

2) we_research_confuzion, to gain_clarity


### aSocioaWronga

Society is so proud and sure of itself, and also conceptual errors exist everywhere.

We often repeat words that sound good, while the concept remain blurry underneath. 
aBlurryaConcepta is highly effective in argument or debate, because it is never totally clear,
what concepts - exactly - exist beneath the words. 

Becauze often, the concepts_change_beneath_words. This not only creates confused_words, but also

confused_concepts, and confused_minds, and ultimately a_confused_society, of actual_dark_ages.
Each measurable, in and of itself, by measure_of_ACTZ and measure_of_WORDZ.

> So deeply we_resist_wrongness out of fear, and when we do it clouds_minds_from_clarity

> No mind can see clearly while filled with smoke, fog, and mud of actual_false_concepts.

> If words are not clear, and concepts are not clear, so too - minds cannot see clearly.

> Minds cannot see clearly, while filled with false concepts. 

Because we first need to correct the illuzion, before clarity can be fully formed.

### aRejectaWronga

Ironically, confuzion and illuzion need_not_be rejected - for excellent reason.


> To see_with_a_clearer_clarity, unfortunatly, it alwayz means we see clearly the actual_flawed_concepts in other minds, and the actual_folly_of_all_human_mind.

> So it seems we are wrong to be ashamed of wrongness, and also wrong to punish wrongness (without first_teaching with best_guidance) - but in addition - appear to be actually wrong... 
for when we_reject_correctness_wrongly and when we_reject_wrongness_wrongly. 

> Becauze even when we are wrong, or when others wrong us, still the ACTZ_best_for_all, 
is to first_teach_as_best_guide - and learn_from_wrongness ~aLearnaWronga~

### aStuckaSocioaStructa

The social structure can be frozen solid, and minds can made to only repeat_concepts_told.

Where anyone_can_see sometimes a_never_a_new_viewz. 

> aSoloFocoa it seems, can often dominate_our_attention, numb_our_senses, overwhelm_our_emotions,
extend_our_silence, and muddy_our_thoughts with confuzion and sometimes `~aIntentaIlluzia~`
